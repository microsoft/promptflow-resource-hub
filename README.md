# Prompt flow ecosystem

Welcome to the **prompt flow ecosystem** - a comprehensive gallery that showcases a variety of use cases demonstrating the the capabilities of prompt flow in building high-quality AI applications.

Here are some common use cases that we've facilitated:

* [**Evaluate semantic kernel planner**](./sample_gallery/evaluate_semantic_kernel_planner/Tutorial.md): This case demonstrates the evaluation of the Semantic Kernel Planner for superior control over AI agent's generation.
* [**Personalized Financial advise using banking customer data on PostgreSQL/CosmosDB**](./sample_gallery/database_querying/cosmosdb_postgresql/Tutorial.md): This example demonstrates how to connect to a CosmosDB database, query data, and use the retrieved information as a reference for AI-generated financial advice.
* [**Natural Language to SQL**](./sample_gallery/nl2sql/README.MD): This is an example for implementing Natural Language to SQL code generation on a sample database using PromptFlow.

In addition, we also provide best practices for:

* [**Golden dataset preparation**](./sample_gallery/golden_dataset/copilot-golden-dataset-creation-guidance.md): Learn how to prepare a golden dataset for your AI application evaluation.

Our Ecosystem serves as a practical guide, providing detailed walkthroughs of each use case for industry, and how to effectively leverage prompt flow in your AI application development process.
